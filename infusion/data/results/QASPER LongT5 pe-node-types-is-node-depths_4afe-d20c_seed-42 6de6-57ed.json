On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. , In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme, For specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.",
