So we directly ask volunteers (attackers) to what extend they would like to continue chatting with the system.\n\nDialog length (Length) Engagement is a subjective metric. Anti-scam system's goal is to engage user in the conversation longer in order to limit their harm to other potential victims. So we count the dialog length as another metric to evaluate system performance.\n\nTask Success Score (TaskSuc) The other goal of the anti-scam system is to elicit attacker's personal information. We count the average type of information (name, address and phone number) that the system obtained from attackers as the task success score.",
