Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme, For specific tasks, we also design a semantic slot annotation scheme for annotating sentences based on their semantic content. We identify 13 main semantic slots in the anti-scam task, for example, credit card numbers. We present a detailed semantic slot annotation in Table TABREF3. Following BIBREF1, we segment each conversation turn into single sentences and then annotate each sentence rather than turns.",

So we directly ask volunteers (attackers) to what extend they would like to continue chatting with the system.\n\nDialog length (Length) Engagement is a subjective metric. Anti-scam system's goal is to engage user in the conversation longer in order to limit their harm to other potential victims. So we count the dialog length as another metric to evaluate system performance.\n\nTask Success Score (TaskSuc) The other goal of the anti-scam system is to elicit attacker's personal information.
